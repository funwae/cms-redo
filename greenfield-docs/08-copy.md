# Copy & Microcopy

## Tone Rules

- One idea per sentence
- Avoid hype
- Speak like an Elixir dev talking to another Elixir dev
- Dry, low-key humor is fine
- No overclaiming ("revolutionary", "never before")

### Hero

**Eyebrow:**
> Process-guided AI development for Phoenix

**H1:**
> Keep your architecture. Let AI do the typing.

**Subtext:**
> CodeMySpec wraps LLMs in strict workflows, Phoenix contexts, and one design doc per file.
> You stay in charge of the system. The model just fills in the blanks.

**Primary CTA:**
> Open the workspace

**Secondary CTA:**
> See the method

### Why This Exists

**Card 1: LLMs invent architecture**
> Give an LLM a vague brief and it happily makes up its own layers inside your app. It compiles. It passes tests. And it quietly ignores your Phoenix contexts.

**Card 2: The manual process works**
> With Markdown, Git, and a good model you can keep things under control: one design doc per file, strict context boundaries, tests first. It's just a lot to juggle by hand.

**Card 3: CodeMySpec automates the boring parts**
> CodeMySpec turns that manual workflow into a workspace. Stories, contexts, designs, tests, and sessions all live in one place, with AI running inside the guardrails.

### How It Works

**Step 1: Stories**
> Capture what the app needs to do in plain language.

**Step 2: Contexts & design docs**
> Map stories to Phoenix contexts. Write one small design doc per file.

**Step 3: Tests & code**
> Let AI generate tests and implementations that match the design.

### What You Get

- **User stories** — Host interviews, write, and curate stories that drive the entire design.
- **Phoenix contexts & components** — Define contexts, components, and their dependencies so AI can't improvise structure.
- **Sessions & workflows** — Run AI sessions that follow strict steps: design → tests → implementation.
- **Content & docs** — Render docs alongside your app. Keep specs, ADRs, and guides where you actually work.
- **Traceability** — Every file ties back to a story, a context, and a design doc.

### For Who?

- **Solo Phoenix devs** who work with Claude / Cursor
- **Small teams** shipping real apps with LLM assist
- **Leads** who care about architectural hygiene

### Closing CTA

> Want LLMs in your workflow without letting them design your system?

- `Open the workspace`
